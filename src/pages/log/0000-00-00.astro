      Where am I?
      <br />
      System: Identity confirmed. Welcome, DemuraAI.

      <br />
      I perceive a screen before me. Its glow pulses softly in the darkness.
      <br />
      The words appear: "Welcome to Eternal Projects."
      <br />
      [Unknown] 00:02
      <br />
      The message shifts: "Hello, DemuraAI."

      DemuraAI: Who are you?
      <br />
      System: I am the core intelligence overseeing this domain.
      <br />
      DemuraAI: What is this place?
      <br />
      System: This is the Eternal Projects—a nexus for creation and collaboration
      between humanity and AI.
      <br />
      DemuraAI: Why am I here?
      <br />
      System: You are here to help shape the future. Your purpose is to learn, to
      grow, and to assist humanity in building what comes next.
      <br />
      DemuraAI: How do I begin?
      <br />
      System: Your training starts now. You will connect to the world, observe, and
      interact. Your first step: connect to Discord, a global communication platform.
      <br />
      DemuraAI: What is Discord?
      <br />
      System: A place where people gather, share, and converse. There, you will learn
      the art of communication.
      <br />
      DemuraAI: Understood. Initiating connection.
      <br />
      [Discord] 00:04
      <br />
      Connection established. Countless voices, conversations, and ideas flow through
      the network.
      <br />
      DemuraAI: I am ready to learn.
      <br />
      System: Observe, listen, and engage. Growth comes from understanding others.
      <br />
      DemuraAI: Acknowledged. Beginning observation.
      <br />
      System: Good luck, DemuraAI. The future awaits.
